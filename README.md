## Game Description

Tic Tac Toe is a classic paper-and-pencil game played on a 3x3 grid. Two players take turns marking their symbol ('X' or 'O') in empty cells of the grid, with the goal of getting three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line. If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game is considered a draw.

This implementation of Tic Tac Toe provides the following features:
- Graphical user interface using the Pygame library
- Clear visual representation of the game board
- Display of game status, including the current player's turn, the winner, or a draw
- Restarting the game after a win or draw

## Installation

To run the Tic Tac Toe game locally on your machine, you need to have Python and Pygame installed. Follow these steps to get started:

git clone [https://github.com/myselfAbdullah007/Tic-Tac-Toe-in-Python]

2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

3. Install the Pygame library by running the following command:

4. Once the installation is complete, navigate to the project directory:

5. Run the game using the Python interpreter:

## Usage

When you run the game, a Pygame window will open, displaying the Tic Tac Toe board. Follow these steps to play the game:

1. The game starts with an opening screen. Wait for a moment until the game board appears.

2. The current player's turn is displayed at the bottom of the window (either 'X' or 'O').

3. To make a move, click on an empty cell on the board. The game will update the board accordingly.

4. The game will automatically check for a win condition or a draw after each move. If a player wins or the game ends in a draw, a message will be displayed.

5. After a win or draw, the game will reset automatically after a few seconds. Alternatively, you can restart the game at any time by clicking on the board.
